## ABOUT THIS DOC

<p>
This doc will briefly introduce myself, my role in the company, what I
value most and how to reach me.
</p>

<!-- .SH -->
## MY ROLE

<p>
I'm a software developer that loves to see how a piece of code
translates to a client satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
I take pride on the small tools that make my life easier and on
automating the tedious tasks.
</p>

<!-- .SH -->
## WHAT I VALUE
<p>
<!-- .TP -->
<!-- .B --> <b>Simplicity</b>
Simpler things describe the world better
</p>

<p>
<!-- .TP -->
<!-- .B --> <b>Proactiveness</b>
Bring me a problem and we can work together in a solution, but a
solution is even more welcome.
</p>

<p>
<!-- .TP -->
<!-- .B --> <b>Freedom</b>
I care about results, I wont judge how they were achieved.
</p>

<p>
<!-- .TP -->
<!-- .B --> <b>Curiosity</b>
Break it to learn from it.
</p>

<p>
<!-- .TP -->
<!-- .B --> <b>Critical Thought</b>
I strongly believe that you can learn more from mistakes than success.
</p>

<p>
<!-- .TP -->
<!-- .B --> <b>Humility</b>
We are all just humans. Unless you are an AI.
</p>

<p>
<!-- .TP -->
<!-- .B --> <b>Humor</b>
I take my work very seriously but I'm also having a lot of fun, both
can coexist together.
</p>

## HOW TO REACH ME

I'm a very accessible person all the time, I prefer async communication
when possible, but live interaction is also an option. You can contact
me by:

<!-- .TP -->
<!-- .B --> <b>Phone call</b>
Rarely happens and my children might be using it, but still an acceptable
method.

<!-- .TP -->
<!-- .B --> <b>Slack</b>
You can expect me to reply you back quickly, unless it's way off my
hours and I'm sleeping.

<!-- .TP -->
<!-- .B --> <b>E-mail</b>
I prefer email for discussions that's better keep a paper trail.

<!-- .TP -->
<!-- .B --> <b>Video call</b>
Still acceptable, but I'm of the opinion that it consumes a lot of
our time, usually an email or a few lines of chat is better.

<!-- .TP -->
<!-- .B --> <b>IRC</b>
Not so much these days, and I miss them.
