## ABOUT THIS DOC

This doc will briefly introduce myself, my role in the company, what I
value most and how to reach me.

<!-- .SH -->
## MY ROLE

I'm a software developer that loves to see how a piece of code
translates to a client satisfaction.

I take pride on the small tools that make my life easier and on
automating the tedious tasks.

<!-- .SH -->
## WHAT I VALUE

<!-- .TP -->
<!-- .B -->
**Simplicity**
Simpler things describe the world better

<!-- .TP -->
<!-- .B -->
**Proactiveness**
Bring me a problem and we can work together in a solution, but a
solution is even more welcome.

<!-- .TP -->
<!-- .B -->
**Freedom**
I care about results, I wont judge how they were achieved.

<!-- .TP -->
<!-- .B -->
**Curiosity**
Break it to learn from it.

<!-- .TP -->
<!-- .B -->
**Critical Thought**
I strongly believe that you can learn more from mistakes than success.

<!-- .TP -->
<!-- .B -->
**Humility**
We are all just humans. Unless you are an AI.

<!-- .TP -->
<!-- .B -->
**Humor**
I take my work very seriously but I'm also having a lot of fun, both
can coexist together.

<!-- .SH -->
## HOW TO REACH ME

I'm a very accessible person all the time, I prefer async communication
when possible, but live interaction is also an option. You can contact
me by:

<!-- .TP -->
<!-- .B -->
**Phone call**
Rarely happens and my children might be using it, but still an acceptable
method.

<!-- .TP -->
<!-- .B -->
**Slack**
You can expect me to reply you back quickly, unless it's way off my
hours and I'm sleeping.

<!-- .TP -->
<!-- .B -->
**E-mail**
I prefer email for discussions that's better keep a paper trail.

<!-- .TP -->
<!-- .B -->
**Video call**
Still acceptable, but I'm of the opinion that it consumes a lot of
our time, usually an email or a few lines of chat is better.

<!-- .TP -->
<!-- .B -->
**IRC**
Not so much these days, and I miss them.
